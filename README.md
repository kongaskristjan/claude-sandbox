# claude-sandbox

A Docker-based sandbox for running Claude Code, OpenCode, or Codex with automatic approvals inside the container. Supports CPU-only, NVIDIA GPU, and Rust workflows.

## What it does

- Runs Claude Code, OpenCode, or Codex inside a Docker container
- Ships a lightweight CPU image by default; opt in to a CUDA image with `--gpu` for deep learning workloads, or a Rust image with `--rust`
- Bind-mounts your project directory so you can edit files from both host (VS Code) and container (Claude Code)
- Forwards your selected agent's subscription login (including Codex ChatGPT login); API keys require `--api-keys`
- Shares your personal skills (`~/.claude/skills`), so they work inside and outside the sandbox
- Enables voice mode (`/voice`) via PulseAudio/PipeWire passthrough
- Auto-rebuilds the container image on each run
- Auto-detects rootless vs rootful Docker and applies appropriate security settings

## Prerequisites

- Linux with Docker installed (rootless or rootful), or macOS with Docker Desktop
- NVIDIA GPU with [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) (only required when using `--gpu`)
- Python 3 on the host (with `tomli` installed on Python older than 3.11 for copying Codex TOML configuration)
- Your chosen agent logged in on the host, or an API key with explicit `--api-keys` opt-in
- PulseAudio or PipeWire (for voice mode)

On Python older than 3.11, install the Codex configuration parser with
`python3 -m pip install tomli`. Python 3.11+ uses the built-in `tomllib` module
and needs no additional package.

## Setup

```bash
git clone <this-repo> ~/claude-sandbox
chmod +x ~/claude-sandbox/claude-sandbox
```

Optionally add to your PATH:

```bash
ln -s ~/claude-sandbox/claude-sandbox ~/.local/bin/claude-sandbox
```

The first run will build the Docker image. The default CPU image is small; `--gpu` switches to a CUDA base image (~10GB download on first build); `--rust` builds a separate image with a rustup toolchain instead of Python.

## Usage

```bash
# Run in current directory (CPU-only)
~/claude-sandbox/claude-sandbox

# Run in a specific project
~/claude-sandbox/claude-sandbox ~/projects/my-dl-project

# Run opencode instead of Claude Code (same image, chosen at runtime)
~/claude-sandbox/claude-sandbox --opencode ~/projects/my-project

# Run Codex with your host ChatGPT login and setup (also works with --rust or --gpu)
~/claude-sandbox/claude-sandbox --codex ~/projects/my-project

# Explicitly opt in to API-key forwarding
~/claude-sandbox/claude-sandbox --codex --api-keys ~/projects/my-project

# Point opencode at an OpenAI-compatible server on the host (e.g. a local
# 'openai serve' on port 8080) instead of a hosted provider
~/claude-sandbox/claude-sandbox --opencode --port 8080 ~/projects/my-project

# Enable NVIDIA GPU passthrough with the CUDA image
~/claude-sandbox/claude-sandbox --gpu ~/projects/my-dl-project

# Use the Rust image (rustup toolchain, cargo caches, no Python/CUDA)
~/claude-sandbox/claude-sandbox --rust ~/projects/my-rust-project

# Enable host networking (rootful Docker only — always on for rootless)
~/claude-sandbox/claude-sandbox --host-network ~/projects/my-dl-project
```

The wrapper auto-detects whether Docker is rootless or rootful and prints the detected mode at startup. Use `--host-network` when you need the container to access services on localhost (e.g., a dev server on port 8080).

Claude Code starts with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, opencode with `--auto`, and Codex with `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` inside the container. Docker provides the isolation boundary. Your project files are mounted at `/workspace/project`.

### Authentication

Subscription/OAuth logins transfer by default. **API keys do not**: exporting
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` alone does not forward them. Pass
`--api-keys` to forward those variables and stored API-key credentials. This
opt-in applies to all three agents, including Claude's legacy `primaryApiKey`.

The wrapper stages only the selected agent's auth/config in private temporary
storage (auth and config files use `0600`) and mounts those copies read-only.
It filters API-key auth entries and API-key fields in JSON and Codex TOML config
before Docker can access them, then removes the temporary files on exit.
Host auth/config files are not modified.
Use the wrapper rather than invoking Compose directly so this staging happens.

**Claude Code** (default): Run `claude` on the host and complete the subscription
login. On macOS, the wrapper exports the `Claude Code-credentials` login Keychain
item to its private temporary directory; expect a Keychain prompt on first use.
With `--api-keys`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` can be used instead.

**Codex** (`--codex`): The wrapper forwards the ChatGPT login tokens from
`$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` (default `~/.codex/auth.json`). It excludes the
`OPENAI_API_KEY` field by default, including when the file also contains OAuth
tokens. Codex runs with file-based credential storage and a trusted
`/workspace/project` directory. Its writable auth, sessions, and config persist
in the `codex-config` volume at `/home/dev/.codex`. A host login is copied on
startup; if none is available, an existing sandbox login is retained. Token
refreshes inside the sandbox stay in that volume and are not written back to
the host.

Each `--codex` launch also copies setup from `$CODEX_HOME` (default `~/.codex`):
top-level TOML files (including `config.toml` and named profiles), `AGENTS.md`,
`AGENTS.override.md`, `instructions.md`, and the `agents`, `skills`, `rules`, and
`prompts` directories. Personal skills from `~/.agents/skills` are copied to
the same location under the container user's home. Skill symlinks are
dereferenced so their contents are available inside the sandbox.

Host setup overwrites matching sandbox files on each launch; files that exist
only in the sandbox are retained. Host sessions, history, logs, and caches are
not copied. The copies are owned by the container user, and changes stay inside
the sandbox. API-key
fields and literal provider `experimental_bearer_token` values in configuration
require `--api-keys`; they are also stripped from retained sandbox configuration
on runs without that option. Custom MCP executables and absolute paths in copied
configuration must be available inside the container.

If your host login is stored only in an OS keyring, create a file-based login
first (see [Codex authentication](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth)):

```bash
codex -c 'cli_auth_credentials_store="file"' login
claude-sandbox --codex
```

A missing Codex login is not fatal: you can also log in inside the container.
With `--api-keys`, a forwarded `OPENAI_API_KEY` takes precedence over the copied
ChatGPT login.

**opencode** (`--opencode`): OAuth entries from
`~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` are forwarded. API-key entries require
`--api-keys`, as do `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Its JSON config at
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` is forwarded with API-key fields removed by
default. State persists in the `opencode-data` volume. A missing host login is
not fatal; opencode can log in interactively inside the container.

**`--port <port>`** points opencode at an OpenAI-compatible server running on the
host (for example a local `openai serve`) instead of a hosted provider. The
wrapper auto-enables host networking so the container can reach the host, and the
entrypoint merges a `local` provider into opencode's config targeting
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1`, auto-discovering the server's models from
`/v1/models` and pre-selecting the first one so `--auto` starts without a prompt
(a user-set `model` in the forwarded config is left alone). It's opencode-only:
passing `--port` without `--opencode` is an error. Override the target host with
`OPENCODE_API_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`, correct under host networking).

### Voice mode

Voice mode (`/voice`) works out of the box. The container routes audio through your host's PulseAudio/PipeWire.

### GPU sharing (CUDA MPS)

With `--gpu`, the entrypoint starts the CUDA MPS control daemon
(`nvidia-cuda-mps-control -d`) so that several processes hitting the same GPU
run their kernels concurrently in one context instead of being time-sliced —
useful when Claude Code runs training, evaluation, and a notebook side by side.
The pipe and log directories are `/tmp/nvidia-mps` and `/var/log/nvidia-mps`
(exported as `CUDA_MPS_PIPE_DIRECTORY` / `CUDA_MPS_LOG_DIRECTORY`).

Set `CLAUDE_SANDBOX_NO_MPS=1` to skip it — MPS clients share one server process,
so a fatal fault in one can take down the others, and Nsight profiling of an MPS
client is restricted. The CPU image ignores the variable; the daemon only starts
when a GPU is actually passed through.

### Rust image

`--rust` builds `Dockerfile.rust`: Ubuntu 24.04 with a rustup-managed stable
toolchain (plus `rustfmt` and `clippy`), Node.js, all three agents and Playwright
CLI — but no Python tooling and no CUDA. Common `-sys` crate build inputs
(`pkg-config`, `libssl-dev`, `cmake`, `build-essential`) are present.

Cargo's caches are persistent named volumes, the same way the uv cache is, so
dependencies are downloaded and compiled once instead of once per container:

| Volume | Path | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo-registry` | `$CARGO_HOME/registry` | downloaded and unpacked crates |
| `cargo-git` | `$CARGO_HOME/git` | git dependency checkouts |
| `cargo-target` | `$CARGO_HOME/target` | build artifacts (`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`) |

Two consequences of `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/home/dev/.cargo/target`:

- Builds inside the sandbox do **not** write a `target/` into your project
  directory, so they can't collide with a `target/` the host built with a
  different toolchain (the same reasoning behind `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=.venv-container`
  in the Python images). Artifacts live at `/home/dev/.cargo/target/<profile>/`
  inside the container; `cargo run` and `cargo test` find them as usual. Run
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target cargo build` for the rare case where you want the
  output in the project directory instead.
- All projects share one target directory, so cargo reuses dependency builds
  whose fingerprint (version, features, profile, compiler) matches across
  projects. `docker volume rm claude-sandbox_cargo-target` clears it if it grows
  too large.

The toolchain itself lives in `$RUSTUP_HOME` (`/home/dev/.rustup`) and
`$CARGO_HOME/bin` — image content, not volumes, so a rebuild always wins over
what an old volume holds. `rustup update` and `cargo install` work inside a
session but, like anything outside the cache volumes, don't survive it.

### Playwright CLI (browser automation)

[Playwright CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) (`playwright-cli`)
and a headless Chromium are pre-installed, so the agent can drive a browser via
shell commands (`playwright-cli open <url>`, `snapshot`, `click e15`, …) with no
setup. Its skill is pre-installed for all agents: as a local plugin for Claude
Code (via `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS`) and in `~/.agents/skills` for opencode and
Codex.

- Only `chrome-headless-shell` is installed; full Chrome-for-Testing crashes
  under the container's security profile. `~/.playwright/cli.config.json` sets
  `"browserName": "chromium"` so the CLI uses it instead of the Chrome channel.
- Output (snapshots, screenshots) goes to `.playwright-cli/` in the current
  directory; add it to the project's `.gitignore`.
- `/opt/playwright-browsers` is a persistent named volume, so the browser is
  baked into `/opt/playwright-seed` and the entrypoint copies missing revisions
  in at start. To upgrade, bump `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_VERSION` in the Dockerfiles and
  rebuild.

### Personal skills

Your host skills directory (`~/.claude/skills`) is bind-mounted read-only at
`/home/dev/.claude/skills`, so a skill you install once on the host is available
both when you run `claude` normally and when you run it in the sandbox. Drop a
`~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` on the host and the next container start picks
it up — nothing to rebuild.

The container's `~/.claude` is a persistent named volume, which would otherwise
mask the host's skills; the mount targets a path *inside* that volume, and Docker
orders mounts by path depth, so the deeper bind wins. It's read-only: skills are
inputs, and the container has no business writing to the host's config.

### Editing files

Files are bind-mounted, so you can:
- Edit in VS Code on the host while Claude Code works inside the container
- Run `git push` from the host (no git credentials are passed to the container)
- Changes from either side are immediately visible to the other

### Options

```
Usage: claude-sandbox [--gpu|--rust] [--host-network] [--update] [--agents|--opencode|--codex] [--api-keys] [--port <port>] [project-dir]

Options:
  --gpu           Use the CUDA image with NVIDIA GPU passthrough
                  (default: CPU-only ubuntu:24.04 image)
  --rust          Use the Rust image (rustup toolchain, no Python or
                  CUDA) with persistent cargo registry and build caches
  --host-network  Use host networking (always enabled for rootless Docker,
                  opt-in for rootful Docker)
  --update        Refresh the agent binaries in the image (other layers
                  stay cached); future runs reuse the refreshed layer
  --agents        Launch the background-agents view ('claude agents')
                  instead of an interactive session
  --opencode      Run opencode instead of Claude Code (same image; the agent
                  is selected at runtime, not baked into one)
  --codex         Run Codex using your host ChatGPT login and setup
  --api-keys      Also forward stored API keys and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY /
                  OPENAI_API_KEY (disabled by default)
  --port <port>   (--opencode only) Point opencode at an OpenAI-compatible
                  server running on the host at this port; auto-enables host
                  networking and auto-discovers the server's models

Environment variables:
  CLAUDE_SANDBOX_MODE=rootless|rootful  Override Docker mode auto-detection
  CLAUDE_SANDBOX_NO_MPS=1               Don't start the CUDA MPS control daemon
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...          API key (requires --api-keys)
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                API key (requires --api-keys)
  CODEX_HOME                          Host Codex directory (default ~/.codex)
```

`--update` writes a timestamp to `~/.cache/claude-sandbox/claude-update-stamp`
(or under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`) and passes it to the build as `CLAUDE_CACHE_BUST`
and `CODEX_CACHE_BUST`. The agent install layers and entrypoint copy are rebuilt;
apt, node, uv, Rust, and the Playwright browser stay cached. Because the stamp persists and is passed on every run, later runs keep
using the refreshed layer instead of matching the stale one.

## Security model

### Rootless Docker (recommended)

In rootless mode, the Docker daemon runs without root privileges. Container UID 0 maps to your host user, making privilege escalation impossible at the kernel level.

The sandbox uses `network_mode: host` for convenience since the container's network namespace is already user-namespaced.

Security properties:
- Container root = your host user (no privilege escalation possible)
- Claude Code runs as non-root `dev` user inside the container
- Only your project directory is exposed, not your home directory or system files
- No git/SSH credentials are passed to the container
- ACLs ensure both the host user and container user can read/write project files

### Rootful Docker

In rootful mode, the Docker daemon runs as root. The sandbox applies additional hardening:

- **No host networking** (default): Uses Docker's default bridge network instead of `network_mode: host`. The container can reach the internet (for Anthropic API calls) but cannot bind host ports or access host-only localhost services. Use `--host-network` to opt in to host networking when needed.
- **`no-new-privileges`**: Prevents any process in the container from gaining additional privileges via setuid/setgid binaries.
- **Minimal capabilities**: Drops all Linux capabilities except the minimum needed for container startup (`CHOWN`, `SETUID`, `SETGID`, `FOWNER`, `DAC_OVERRIDE`). These are used only by the entrypoint script; Claude Code runs as non-root and has no capabilities.

Security properties:
- Claude Code runs as non-root `dev` user inside the container
- Only your project directory is exposed, not your home directory or system files
- No git/SSH credentials are passed to the container
- No host network access
- No capability escalation possible

## What's inside the container

Every image:

- Node.js 22
- Claude Code (native binary with voice support)
- opencode (native binary; select with `--opencode`)
- Codex (`@openai/codex`; select with `--codex`)
- git, git-lfs, curl, wget, build-essential, cmake
- [Playwright CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) + headless Chromium and its OS deps

Per image:

| | default | `--gpu` | `--rust` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base | Ubuntu 24.04 | CUDA 13.0 + cuDNN on Ubuntu 24.04 | Ubuntu 24.04 |
| Python 3.12 + pip + venv + uv | ✅ | ✅ | —* |
| CUDA toolkit / NVIDIA passthrough | — | ✅ | — |
| rustup (stable, rustfmt, clippy) + cargo caches | — | — | ✅ |

\* The Rust image installs no Python tooling, but a bare `python3` interpreter
comes in as a dependency of the NodeSource `nodejs` package.

## Customization

### Adding Python packages to the base image

Add to the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
RUN pip install torch torchvision --break-system-packages
```

### Disabling voice mode

Remove the PulseAudio-related volumes and environment variables from `docker-compose.yml`, and the `sox`/`alsa`/`pulseaudio` packages from `docker/apt-base.sh`.

## Development checks

```bash
bash -n claude-sandbox entrypoint.sh
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Tests use synthetic credentials and mocked container commands. Compose rendering
is also checked when Docker Compose is installed; no Docker daemon or API calls
are needed.
